          <h4>What’s a Milonga?</h4>
          <p classname="Process-p-list-intro">
            Milonga is a type of tango music, and also the name for an event where people dance tango and socialize. We are used to seeing performance tango on TV, with lots of choreographed drama and intricate steps, but at social dances — milongas — it’s more about the relationships between music and dancers, between dancers and their partners, and among the couples as they move around the dance floor. The dances are improvised, a conversation between partners, and you can have a great dance with some very simple steps. The music is passionate and haunting, Argentina’s version of the blues, often with similar kinds of lyrics about pain, loss and betrayal. An overall theme is that life is often harsh but you shrug your shoulders and dance.

            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p className="Process-p-list-intro">
                Libby has been living rough on the streets and sleeping in the woods for five years, drinking, not drinking, selling her handmade baskets, eating at the soup kitchen where she interacts with no one, trying to blot out the agonizing event that jettisoned her into a living death.  She resists the efforts of her A.A. sponsor, Pilar, to pierce her numbness, until one night, drunk and dumpster diving, she is seduced by tango music that draws her in despite herself.  Told through a unique combination of still photographs, painted backgrounds, narration, sound, and music, the story explores the complexities of support and betrayal, despair and hope, and the rocky road of the the human spirit.

            <h4>The Process</h4>
            <p className="Process-p-list-intro">Milonga began as a film script by Julie Reichert.  She didn’t have the means to get it produced, so how to get it into the world?</p>
            <ul className="Process-unmarked-list">
                <li>Post the script online?</li>
                <li>An audio version as well, so you could both read it and hear it?</li>
                <li>How, how about some pictures?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And so it began.  At first with a straight recording of the script (thank you, Kate Costello), then a green screen in the living room and some actors (our talented heroine, Pip Lustgarten, plus many more), with Bill Mohr as photographer and digital image builder.  A light going on in Tor Kingdon’s head during the recording at Hear Kitty Studios, followed by an offer by Hear Kitty’s CEO & Chief Sound Artist Kathleen “Kat” Edwards and him to co-produce a fully developed audio version.  Locations and background characters drawn by Betsy Cunningham.  Many script re-writes to adapt to a new medium.</p> 
            <p>Something initially simple became very complicated — thousands of photographs to produce the 450 images used in the final project.  Many actors, both for the visuals and the soundtrack.  Untold gigabytes of recordings, in-depth mixing, Foley, and sound design by Kat & Tor.  Generous musical contributions by Q-Tango, and a score by CK Barlow.  Visual editing by Brad Stoddard.</p>
            <p>The project developed over six and a half years, two of which included the pandemic.  All involved had other lives with many demands.  Many times we wondered if we’d ever finish.  Some participants forgot they’d ever been involved.  But here we have it, a real live movie. </p>
