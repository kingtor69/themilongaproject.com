                Libby has been living rough on the streets and sleeping in the woods for five years, drinking, not drinking, selling her handmade baskets, eating at the soup kitchen where she interacts with no one, trying to blot out the agonizing event that jettisoned her into a living death.  She resists the efforts of her A.A. sponsor, Pilar, to pierce her numbness, until one night, drunk and dumpster diving, she is seduced by tango music that draws her in despite herself.  Told through a unique combination of still photographs, painted backgrounds, narration, sound, and music, the story explores the complexities of support and betrayal, despair and hope, and the rocky road of the the human spirit.
